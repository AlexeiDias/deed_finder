STEP #05 - DEED HUNTER METHOD

AHO, HUNTER!

Welcome to step five of the Deed Hunter Method!

The fifth step of the Deed Hunter Method is to find out the fair market value.

It's very important that you know the market value of the property. Well, we're basically in this business to make money, right? And you won't be able to figure out how much money you're going to make if you don't know what the market value of the property is.

Once you figure that out, you can also figure out the Spread.

Spread: Difference between the market value and the minimum bid.

Having done this, all you need to find out, on top, are the repair costs, if any.

So when you get to this stage of due diligence, you should start thinking about exit strategies. The biggest mistake most new investors make is to buy the property first and figure out what to do later. That's not the case with you and it won't be! You're a well-informed investor and you always buy properties that have at least three exit strategies, right?

With that in mind, there are a few ways to find out the market value. They are:

‚óè Realtor: In every region where you plan to do business having a Realtor is the way to go.

Zillow, Trulia and Realtor.com: These websites can give the light as to market value as well, although sometimes depending on the market, depending on the market, the data can be out of date. Please don't get too excited when one of these sites shows a market value that is too good to be true. The best thing is to double-check with several sources and always, always compare with the Assessed Value that can be found in the Appreisal District.

Example: Browsing Trulia.

1- Search for Trulia on Google.

2 - Once on one of the sites, paste the address of the property.

3 - Find the assessed value.
