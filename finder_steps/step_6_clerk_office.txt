AHO, HUNTER!

Welcome to the sixth step of the Deed Hunter Method!

Landlord information

You'll also find property liens here

IRS liens (drops after 120 days), demolition liens, etc.

Any city or county lien survives

P.S. Read the rules! Depending on the situation, all liens are eliminated and you can skip step 6!

SEARCH: county + state + clerk's office i.e. "Montgomery county texas clerk's office"
